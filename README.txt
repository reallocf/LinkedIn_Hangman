A simple command line hangman game


Build instructions:

    If you do not have python 3, follow the guide here:

    https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download

    If you do not have pip3, follow the first stackoverflow response here:

    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6587507/how-to-install-pip-with-python-3

    Now that that's taken care of, all you have to do is run the following command from the command line while in the directory of this codebase:

        pip3 install -r requirements.txt

    And voila! You should be able to run this code.


Run instructions:

    All it takes is one line on the command line while in the codebase's directory:

        python3 start.py


Play instructions:

    Hopefully the game is self-explanatory.

    I included a help feature that details what a user can do at any point in the game.
